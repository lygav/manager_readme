## Hi, as your manager

I’m excited to get to know you more organically through chats, taking on challenges together, and day to day activities,  
but a few up-front things about my philosophies that might be helpful.

## I am here for you

My whole role exists in a team context, and I’m just a small part of this wider ecosystem. 
I’m here to help, support, mentor you, and to set context for what you’re working on, and to advocate for you and the team with the rest of the company.
I’m excited to invest and nurture that ecosystem for the long haul! 
In terms of what I need, it’s honest feedback and a safe, inclusive work environment for each of us to be trusting and fully engaged.

## Engineering Excellence and Process

> "Place the right process, and the right product will follow." - James Coplien.

I feel strong about having simple, low overhead process, but process nonetheless.
I use Scrum as a framework to design such process.  
That said, I'm very wary to not highjack Agile principles and promote them in an Orwellian way,  
but to embrace thinking and finding balances instead of following how-tos (or just let people go loose).  
At the end of the day, these are my key values:

 - I value ability to get stuff done.
 - I value your time and don’t want you to do any process that is neither beneficial to you nor required by law, policy, etc.
 - I value continuous improvement, and I expect you to learn, improve and grow yourself continuously. I'll make sure you have the opportunity.
 - I value courage without wich we cannot have transparency about what’s happened, what’s happening, and what’s going to happen.

## Direct responsibility

 - You’re here because of your experience and your skills and I don’t want to override either of those.  
   I’m here to help us succeed together, but not to hold your hand.
 - If I think you’re headed down the wrong path, I’ll definitely try to dissuade you,  
   but disagreeing with my input does not indicate that you’re doing something wrong.
 - You’ll still need to get consensus, agreement, and input from your teammates. 

## Professionalism

>"When you believe in things you don't understand Then you suffer" - Stevie Wonder

As professionals we should try to always support our assumptions with data.  
If there is no data available, try to make it yourself.

## Clear Communication

Words have meanings. There are few things i appreciate more 
then the ability to communicate clearly. 

## Domain Expertise

> "The most valuable asset in the software industry is the synthesis of programming skill and deep context in the business problem domain, in one skull." - Jesse Watson, Amazon

I expect you to learn your domain, and become an expert in it.

## Feedback

Feedback is a big part of how we learn and adapt.
I'm dedicated to provide you with direct and timely feedback.
And I hope you'll do the same for me.

## Im very interested in mentoring, and personal growth

Finding your areas of interests and work together towards your growth, contributions and accomplishments in these areas is something I see as part of my job. 
Your personal and career growth is important to me - so I am always looking to hear from you where you would like to grow next, and help you get there!

# 1:1's

I'm big on one-on-ones too. These are for you, and are great for you to actively set an agenda. Think What would you like to talk about? What’s going well? What’s bugging you?
My aim is that we’ll have at least 30 minutes a week.

# Your Philosophies

I’ve written a lot here about my philosophies but a fair amount of my job is adapting to your needs and philosophies, and I look forward to talking to you about them!

I’m looking forward to celebrate many wins with you!
